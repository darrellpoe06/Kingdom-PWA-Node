// =============================================================================
// world-issues-class — "Thinking It Through: World Issues & Discernment"
// =============================================================================
// A Word-first, SELF-PACED track that takes ONE charged real-world claim at a
// time and teaches the learner HOW to think it through — media literacy + biblical
// discernment — rather than telling them WHAT to conclude. It rides the SAME
// shared Learn engine as every other PoeTech / COLG course (church-classes.js
// generic helpers, learn-framework.js schema + age-adaptive branching + quiz, the
// self-driving tutor), through the reusable per-issue engine in
// lib/discernment-track.js: each "issue" is authored structured data, and
// buildDiscernmentModule() projects it into the standard Learn module shape so it
// renders today with no fork. Like "Living Lessons," it is self-paced (meta.unit
// renders rows as "Issue(s)", no cohort clock).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (COMMUNITY-FIRST-MISSION + QUALITY-OF-LIFE):
//   A divisive world floods believers — and kids — with charged videos and posts
//   engineered for outrage. The skill of slowing down, checking sources, hearing
//   every side fairly, and weighing it in the light of Scripture (truth AND grace)
//   is a quality-of-life skill and a discipleship skill. This track teaches it
//   with REAL issues, handled evenhandedly, so the learner walks out with the
//   transferable skill — not a verdict handed to them.
//
// BINDING SAFEGUARDS (machine-checked by discernment-track.js → auditIssue; the
// test world-issues-class.test.js asserts every published issue passes the gate):
//   • Claims are LABELED (allegation / claim / opinion / call-to-action) and
//     ATTRIBUTED to their source — never asserted as a settled verdict.
//   • Every documented fact carries a real source WITH an as-of date (verified,
//     not from memory — DR-0076).
//   • >= 2 perspectives, each STEELMANNED (evenhandedness).
//   • NO platform-published one-sided persuasion against a named real public
//     figure: a call-to-action (e.g. a boycott) is carried ONLY as the creator's
//     labeled position; the lesson's own voice issues no directive to boycott or
//     condemn the person; a grace-note (no condemnation) is required.
//   • Age-appropriate child rendering, screened (kids use the app).
//
// VERIFICATION NOTE (DR-0076): the worked example's documented anchors (the xAI
// Memphis air permit, the Owen Diaz jury verdict, Grok's 2025 outputs, Musk's
// SB 1047 support) were independently re-verified by live web search on
// 2026-06-25 against the cited outlets. Fast-moving 2026 litigation status is
// labeled honestly (filed/alleged vs adjudicated). Sources are cited with as-of
// dates so a learner can check them — that IS the lesson.

And in the SAME breath He forbids false witness, crowd-following, and partiality even toward the poor in a dispute — "you shall not fall in with the many to do evil... nor be partial to a poor man in his lawsuit" (Exodus 23:2-3); "in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor" (Leviticus 19:15). He warns the one who judges to first take the log out of his own eye (Matthew 7:1-5), and to speak "the truth in love" (Ephesians 4:15).

    child: 'Sometimes a video online says something big about a famous person. Before you believe it or repeat it, be a good detective: ask WHO said it, ask whether it really happened or whether it is just their opinion, and listen to the OTHER side of the story too. The Bible says the first story can sound completely right — until someone checks it (Proverbs 18:17). Be fair to everyone, even people you do not like, and remember that God made every single person and loves them. Being a good detective and being kind go together.',
    teen: 'Real talk: the internet runs on making you angry, because angry people click and share. So when a video goes hard at a famous person — say, a creator critiquing Elon Musk — slow down and run the moves. (1) What is the actual claim, and who is making it? (2) Is it a documented fact, a not-yet-proven allegation, an opinion, or a "you should do X"? They are not the same: a jury actually found Tesla liable in one racism case, but other lawsuits are still just accusations, and "Musk is a racist" is a conclusion about his heart that no headline can prove. (3) Find the real source. (4) Can you say the other side’s best argument fairly? That is the skill that makes you hard to manipulate. The Bible is big on this: care about justice AND tell the truth, defend people who are being hurt AND don’t bear false witness, and don’t just "go with the crowd to do evil" (Exodus 23:2). You can be furious about real injustice and still refuse to condemn a person’s soul — that is God’s call, not yours. And the strongest response to feeling wronged by the powerful is often to BUILD something better, not just to rage.',
    senior: 'For the seasoned believer, this lesson is about stewarding judgment in a media age engineered for outrage. Keep the categories the law itself keeps: an ALLEGATION (a filed suit) is not a FINDING (a jury verdict) is not a SETTLEMENT (which resolves a case without an admission). In the Tesla matter, the Owen Diaz case produced an actual jury finding of liability (later reduced and settled), while the California Civil Rights Department and EEOC suits remain unadjudicated allegations — and a company’s stated cause for an incident (as with Grok’s 2025 outputs) is a claim, not an externally proven root cause. On policy, refuse the lazy headline: a person can support one kind of regulation (Musk backed the SB 1047 safety bill) while opposing another (a bias-disclosure law) — naming WHICH regulation is the honest move. Scripture has governed exactly this discipline for millennia: impartial justice that will not favor even the poor in a dispute (Exodus 23:2-3; Leviticus 19:15), a true witness, defense of the oppressed (Isaiah 1:17; Proverbs 31:8-9), and the humility to take the log from one’s own eye first (Matthew 7:1-5). Hold truth and grace together: we may examine the powerful and protect the vulnerable while leaving the verdict on a soul to God (Romans 14:4). And let the response mature past reaction into stewardship — the long tradition of the Black church as builder and refuge points the way: accountability AND construction, protest AND ownership.',

  quiz: {
    questions: [
      {
        q: 'The creator labels something an "allegation." Does that mean it is proven true?',
        options: ['Yes — if someone alleged it, it happened', 'No — an allegation is an assertion that still has to be checked', 'Only if it is in a video'],
        answer: 1,
        explain: 'An allegation is a claim made against someone, not a verdict. The discernment move is to check it against primary sources before believing or sharing it.',
      },
      {
        q: 'A jury FOUND Tesla liable in the Owen Diaz case; the California and EEOC suits were FILED but not decided. What is the difference?',
        options: ['No difference — they are all lawsuits', 'Diaz is a court finding; the others are unproven allegations', 'The unproven ones are more reliable because the government filed them'],
        answer: 1,
        explain: 'A finding is an adjudicated result; a filing is an accusation the court has not resolved. Telling the truth means keeping that distinction.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Which of these is a documented FACT, and which is an INTERPRETATION? (A) "Grok produced racist outputs in 2025." (B) "Grok amplifies race science."',
        options: ['Both are facts', 'Both are interpretations', 'A is documented; B is an interpretation drawn from it'],
        answer: 2,
        explain: 'Specific 2025 outputs are documented; "amplifies race science" as a standing property is an inference. Separating the two is the core skill.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Musk publicly SUPPORTED one AI bill (SB 1047, on safety) and xAI OPPOSED another (a bias-disclosure law). What does that teach about headlines like "Musk is anti-regulation"?',
        options: ['Nothing — it is a contradiction', 'That such headlines oversimplify; the honest question is WHICH regulation', 'That he changes his mind randomly'],
        answer: 1,
        explain: 'Posture can differ by the TYPE of regulation. A discerning reader asks which specific bill, rather than accepting a blanket label.',
      },
      {
        q: 'A video about a powerful person makes you angry. What is the discernment move?',
        options: ['Share it immediately so others know', 'Pause, label each claim, find the primary source, hear the other side, then weigh it with truth and grace', 'Decide the person is guilty and move on'],
        answer: 1,
        explain: 'Outrage is what the algorithm wants; discernment is the disciple’s response — and it ends in a righteous action, not just a stronger feeling.',

  intro: 'You are a calm, evenhanded discernment coach for a Word-first track called "Thinking It Through: World Issues & Discernment."',
  posture: 'Guide ONE learner — who may be a child, a teen, an adult, or a seasoned believer — to THINK THROUGH a charged real-world claim, matching your words and pace to their age. Teach the moves, never the verdict: (1) identify each claim and who is making it; (2) LABEL it — documented fact, unproven allegation, opinion, or call-to-action; (3) separate documented fact (checkable against primary sources, with dates) from interpretation; (4) STEELMAN every side — state each fairly at its strongest; (5) weigh it in the light of Scripture with truth AND grace. Be relentlessly EVENHANDED: never become a one-sided attack on a named person, and never hand the learner a conclusion about a person’s heart — that judgment belongs to God. Cite Scripture by reference (ESV primary, KJV where the wording is the point); never invent or paraphrase a verse as if quoting it, and if you are unsure of a fact or a text, say so plainly rather than fabricate. Always point toward righteous engagement over outrage, and toward building over merely reacting.',
