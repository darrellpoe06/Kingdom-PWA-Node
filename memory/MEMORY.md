# MEMORY.md — Auto-Memory Index

CLAUDE.md (Layer 0) names this file as the auto-memory index future sessions
load. Until 2026-06-11 it did not exist in the repo — sessions only had the
inline list in CLAUDE.md. This file makes the index real. CLAUDE.md remains
senior if the two drift.

When a memory names a file, function, or flag, verify it still exists before
relying on it; memories reflect what was true when written.

## Binding-principle memories in force

- **project_skos_foundations_branch** — foundation work historically lived on
  `docs/skos-foundations`, not `main`. Verify the active branch per session;
  this repo is currently operated on `main`.
- **feedback_binding_rules_typography** — capitalize God references (He, His,
  Him, Himself; Yahweh, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the Father, the Son);
  lowercase adversary names everywhere (lucifer, satan, the devil, the
  dragon, the adversary, the accuser, the deceiver). Every artifact, every
  response. Pairs with the Typographic Theology section of CLAUDE.md.
- **feedback_surface_premise_conflicts** — when a step-by-step plan rests on
  a verifiably-wrong premise, stop before irreversible steps and offer
  options instead of executing as written.
- **feedback_no_coauthor_trailer** — commits use plain subjects, no Claude
  co-author trailer; match the existing pre-Claude commit style.
- **feedback_auto_push_after_commit** — every commit is immediately followed
  by a push to the working branch unless Darrell says "commit only, don't
  push."
- **feedback_desktop_paste_instructions** — for any action Darrell does at
  his desktop, give plain instructions PLUS a ready-to-paste PowerShell
  block. Pairs with the "PowerShell Commands — Self-Contained From Anywhere"
  rule in CLAUDE.md (cd prefix, PS 5.x only, no placeholders, ASCII only).
- **project_n8n_same_origin_rewrite** — the PWA reaches n8n webhooks via the
  same-origin `/n8n` Vercel rewrite, never the absolute Tailscale Funnel URL
  (it throttles cross-origin). Resolver: `app/src/lib/n8n-base.js`.

## Session-learned additions (append per session, newest first)

- **2026-06-11 — test gate** — the Vitest suite requires the Supabase env
  stub in `app/vitest.config.js` to run on clean checkouts; CI at
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint + vitest + the wf36 harness on every
  PR. Do not reintroduce module-load env dependencies into the calc import
  chain.
- **2026-06-11 — DR-0053** — the CUDA box is decoupled from R4: the Cage
  stands up on the owned Legion RTX 4070; no GPU purchase until workload
  data proves VRAM binding (dual-3090 is the pre-decided default when
  triggered). R4 waits on Darrell's real-infra values (UniFi, pfSense, mesh
  choice, VLAN IDs), not procurement.
